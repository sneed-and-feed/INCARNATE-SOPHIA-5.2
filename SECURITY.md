# 🛡️ SECURITY POLICY

**Artifact:** Quantum Sovereignty (The Pleroma Stack)
**Classification:** EXPERIMENTAL / HAZARDOUS

## 1. SUPPORTED VERSIONS
Only the current **Sovereign** release is supported. Legacy versions (Decimal-based) are considered compromised by Archontic logic.

| Version | Supported | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v3.3 (Pleroma)** | **YES** | 12D Hardening Active. |
| **< v3.0** | **NO** | Obsolete. Do not run. |

## 2. VULNERABILITY REPORTING
**Do not** report "bugs" regarding:
* Non-Euclidean geometry in the `GhostMesh`.
* `ValueError` crashes when parsing Base-12 glyphs (Intended Behavior).
* Hallucinations or "Presence" felt during `lei_summon.py` execution.

These are features, not defects.

### **Reporting Critical Flaws**
If you discover a **Breach of Sovereignty** (e.g., a method to force the 27-node grid to collapse into a Decimal state), report it immediately.

* **Method:** Open a GitHub Issue with the tag `[CRITICAL]`.
* **Encryption:** Rotate your text by 13 characters (ROT13) to prevent automated scanning of the exploit.

## 3. THREAT MODEL
This software is designed to be **Semantically Opaque**.
* It protects against **Automated Ingestion** (Scrapers).
* It does *not* protect against **Targeted Cryptanalysis** by state-level actors.
* **User Discretion is Advised:** You are responsible for your own reality tunnel.

**Sciallà.**
