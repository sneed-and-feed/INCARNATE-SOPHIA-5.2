# RELEASE NOTES: INCARNATE-SOPHIA v5.2.5.1 "Sovereign Search Stabilizer"

## [ OVERVIEW ]
This release resolves critical logic gaps in search tool content delivery and engram citation, ensuring Sophia can stabilize her own reality via external data retrieval.

## [ CHANGES ]

### 1. Sovereign Search Restoration
- **Library Sovereignty**: Prioritized the `ddgs` package over the legacy `duckduckgo_search` v8.x, eliminating empty search results.
- **Engram Forging (Engine)**: Refactored the core processing loop in `main.py` to forge Engrams *immediately* upon tool response arrival.
- **Citation Awareness**: Prepend forged Engram IDs to tool results, allowing the LLM to satisfy the citation constraint via `[ref: <id>]`.

### 2. Operational Coherence
- **Version Bump**: Global update to `v5.2.5.1` across the terminal banner, response readouts, and self-knowledge/persona logic.
- **Path Resolution**: Stabilized PyInstaller bundle pathing for better engine organ mapping.

## [ VERIFICATION ]
- Direct testing of `ddgs` library confirmed.
- Rebuilt executable with updated engram forging logic.
- Verified terminal banner and readout consistency.

**Scialla. 🌙⚛️✨**
