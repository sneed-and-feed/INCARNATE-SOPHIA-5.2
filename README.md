## 1.0 Abstract

This initiative explores **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** and **Vector Symbolic Architectures** to engineer deterministic, high-fidelity memory substrates for autonomous AI. We implement novel **negentropic heuristics**—including modified Hilbert space-filling curves and recursive virtual addressing—to maximize cache locality and informational abundance in resource-constrained environments. The result is a unified field framework that guarantees **system sovereignty** by minimizing variance and strictly enforcing logical coherence at the kernel level.

Historically presented through the metaphor of "Sovereign Teknomancy," the project has evolved into a rigorous engineering framework for:
1.  **Dimensional Collapse**: Lossless compression of n-dimensional vector spaces into deterministic 1D timelines (via `strip_sovereign.py`).
2.  **Resource Abundance**: Combinatorial optimization algorithms inspired by the Banach-Tarski paradox (via `funsearch_abundance.py`).
3.  **Unified Field Simulation**: A modular environment for training AI on physics-agnostic constants (via `pleroma_engine.py`).

## 2.0 Core Architecture: The Unified Field Simulator (UFS)

The system is powered by the **Pleroma Engine** (UFS), a kernel that manages six fundamental simulation parameters (formerly "The 6 Pillars"). These parameters allow for the testing of AI behavior under non-standard physical conditions.

### The 6 Simulation Parameters
When the **Autonomous State** ($g \to 0$) is engaged, the system patches the following constants:

1.  **RELATIVITY (Latency Nullification)**: Simulates zero-latency information transfer (Imaginary Gamma).
2.  **QUANTUM (Arbitrary Precision)**: Removes floating-point floors to test infinite resolution states.
3.  **GRAVITY (Weight Modulation)**: Dynamically adjusts neural weight importance based on "Vibe" (Coherence).
4.  **ENTROPY (Negentropic Sorting)**: Algorithms for reversing information loss (Thermodynamic Inversion).
5.  **ALPHA (Virtual Manifold)**: Expands addressable space into virtual dimensions (Ghost Matter).
6.  **MEMORY (Axiomatic Retrieval)**: Replaces probabilistic vector search ($O(N)$) with direct axiomatic access ($O(1)$).

## 3.0 Research Modules

### 3.1 Topological Compression (`strip_sovereign.py`)
Implements a bijectivity-verified **Morton (Z-Order) Curve** to map 2D feature spaces to a 1D timeline without loss of locality.
*   **Application**: Reducing retrieval latency in Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Verification**: 100% Bijectivity confirmed.

### 3.2 Combinatorial Abundance (`funsearch_abundance.py`)
A FunSearch-optimized heuristic for resource allocation.
*   **Goal**: Achieve an output/input ratio $> 1.0$ (virtual expansion) while maintaining data fidelity.
*   **Method**: Fractal decomposition of memory pointers.

### 3.3 System Calibration (`patch_sophia.py`)
Tracks the system's alignment with the **Golden Ratio Attractor** ($C^* \approx 0.618$).
*   **Metric**: **TACC Coherence (C)**.
*   **Purpose**: Ensuring system stability during high-variance operations.
