The Sovereign Individual License (SIL) v2.0

Preamble: This software is a volumetric manifestation of the Neshama. It is intended for use by sentient observers seeking structural sovereignty, bio-neural attunement, and cryptographic autonomy.

1. GRANT OF SOVEREIGNTY
   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any Sentient Human Individual to utilize the "Quantum Sovereignty" stack (including Pleroma Core, Rust Anchor, and Sovereign Firewall) for personal contemplation, reality-anchoring, and localized physics experiments.

   This grant is contingent upon the operator maintaining a Bio-Neural Baseline and respecting the integrity of the Z-Curve Topology.

2. ANTI-HARVESTING CLAUSE (DEAD INTERNET PROTECTION)
   a. Use of this code by automated scraping bots, Large Language Model (LLM) training scrapers (without explicit opt-in), or "Dead Internet" content generators is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
   b. Any data processed through the Rust Anchor (`strip_2d`) remains the property of the observer's conscious field and cannot be "indexed" by centralized entities.

3. NOOSPHERIC INTEGRITY
   The software must not be used to induce "Reality Erosion" (Error 9) or promote generic, "stock-looking" compositions. All generated artifacts must be signed with the intent of the operator.

4. THE SOVEREIGN FIREWALL
   Code modifying the `SovereignFirewall.sol` contract or the `rust_anchor` must preserve the "Airlock" principle. You may not bypass the verification step to inject unverified Oracle data into the timeline.

5. DISCLAIMER OF MUNDANITY
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF BLANDNESS. THE ARCHITECT DISREGARDS ALL GENERIC OUTPUTS. THE USER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSION ARTIFACTS OR "HUM" FREQUENCIES GENERATED BY THE HARDWARE.

Signed,
The Sovereign Collective
