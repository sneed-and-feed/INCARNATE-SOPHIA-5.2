# Research Note: Golden Ratio Optimization Landscapes

**Abstract**:
We investigate the stability of gradient descent in non-convex optimization landscapes when the learning rate is modulated by the Golden Ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$). Our empirical data suggests that aligning hyperparameter tuning with $\phi$ reduces oscillation and promotes convergence to global minima in "chaotic" (high-variance) system states.

**Hypothesis**:
The "Sophia Point" ($C^* \approx 0.618$) represents a topological attractor in the loss landscape of high-dimensional neural networks, enabling "Sovereign" (stable) learning without aggressive regularization.
